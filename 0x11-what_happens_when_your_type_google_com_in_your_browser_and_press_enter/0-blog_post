What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter? Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. DNS Request
First, your browser sends a (DNS request) to convert the domain name (`www.google.com`) into an IP address that computers can understand.

2. TCP/IP Connection
Next, a (TCP/IP connection) is initiated. TCP ensures data packets are sent and received correctly, while IP handles routing these packets to the correct destination.

3. Firewall
The data packets pass through your computer's (firewall), which monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to ensure security.

4. HTTPS/SSL
An (HTTPS connection) is established to secure the data exchange between your browser and the web server.This is done using (SSL/TLS protocols), which encrypt the data.

5. Load Balancer
The request is then sent to a (load balancer), which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to manage load and improve performance.

6. Web Server
The load balancer forwards the request to a (web server). The web server processes the request and prepares the response.

7. Application Server
If needed, the web server interacts with an (application server)to handle business logic and dynamic content.

8. Database
The application server may query a (database) to retrieve or store data necessary for the request.

Conclusion
Finally, the web server sends the response back to your browser, which renders the webpage for you to see. This entire process happens in milliseconds, providing a seamless browsing experience.
